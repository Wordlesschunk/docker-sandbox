Simple sandbox container to develop web apps on

to create the container -> docker-compose -d
to stop the container -> docker-compose down
to start the container -> docker-compose up -d

to connect to a service -> docker exec -it [nameOfService] bash

connecting my mysql once within the service -> mysql -u root -p

this container image is meant to be used on local and not on production.
